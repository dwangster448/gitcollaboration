Merge conflict b/t develop and conflict_branch: A change on develop and a change to the same filed based on the previous commit in develop.

No merge conflict b/t develop and conflict_branch: An addition on develop on index.html and a seperate addition on conflict_branch on index.html, the merge will just add the two file changes onto one branch.
